# Image Captioning using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project implements an **Image Captioning system** using deep learning techniques. The goal is to generate descriptive textual captions for input images by combining **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** methods. The implementation is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation and visualization.

## Features

- End-to-end deep learning pipeline for image captioning using a Jupyter Notebook.
- Pre-trained CNN models for feature extraction.
- Caption generation using NLP techniques such as RNNs.
- Evaluation metrics such as BLEU scores for assessing caption quality.

## Dataset

The project uses the **ROCO** (Radiology Objects in COntext) dataset, which contains radiology images paired with their corresponding captions. This dataset is well-suited for generating text descriptions of medical images.

For more information on the ROCO dataset, please visit: [ROCO Dataset](https://github.com/roco-dataset)

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following components:

1. **Image Feature Extractor**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large dataset extracts features from images.
2. **Caption Generator**: A recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model generates captions from the extracted features.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritik650/Image-Captioning-using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Image-Captioning-using-Deep-Learning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook if it's not already installed:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `Image_Captioning.ipynb`) in your browser.
   
6. Ensure the ROCO dataset is downloaded and preprocessed. Update the dataset path in the notebook if necessary.

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook step-by-step to:

   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate the model.
   - Generate captions for test images.

2. To test the model, upload your image and run the relevant cell in the notebook to generate captions.

## Results

Include examples of:

- Input images from the ROCO dataset.
- Generated captions.
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU scores).
